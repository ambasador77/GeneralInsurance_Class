# About Git and GitHub

### What is Git
Git is a version control system that helps developers to keep track of the changes in their codes and/or other files. This system was created to enable programming collaboration while being able to compare the changes between the separate code submissions and to compare the changes of code between developers.

It was created by Linus Torvalds for development of Linux. To learn more about the history of Git, have a look at its [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git).


### What is GitHub
GitHub is a web service that integrates Git as a version control system. On GitHub you can create an account where you can have your own repositories (=Git projects) and take advantage of Git features. Basically it is a web page where you can use Git directly from menus, dropdowns and buttons without having to understand in depth what it actually does in the background.

These repositories can be then synchronized to your computer.


### How we will use GitHub
As you can see, the whole class is stored on GitHub as a repository. This enables the creators of the class to collaborate on development of the class contents.

That is, however, not the only advantage. You will use it, as a student, to keep your repository always up-to-date with the latest changes made in the original course material. It will enable you to synchronize your works throughout all the devices on which you work. You will also be able to access the full history of changes you will make. And in the end you will learn how you can use the GitHub for cooperation with others.

The course material will be shared on Github, exercises will be posted in RStudio cloud. From your side there is no need to create Github account nor installing Git on your machine. On the other hand, it is possible to have the whole setup stored locally on your machine using a clone of this repository. If you wish to learn something new, you are free to try it.

### Will we use Git?
Yes and no. The usage of Git is integrated in the GitHub itself. So you will be able to use some of the basic features of Git directly from GitHub web user interface.

On the other hand, the usage of Git from your local machine will not be required. This part will be left as an option for you to use with a simple tutorial provided at the end of this lesson.


### Setting up an account
To create a new account, go to the GitHub signup page and follow the instructions. Note that your GitHub account name will be visible to all participants of the course and we will use it for direct communication with you throughout the class.
